# Linear Regression, kinda explained

Here, I have 2 notebooks trying to explain linear regression, and implementing them via gradient desent.

Although we can compute linear regression with linear algebra, doing via gradient desent enforces the concept of gradient desent, which will help in other stuff.

In 1st notebook, I've used sklearn - A popular library for ML tasks, to do regression.

In 2nd notebook, I've tried my best to implement a model from scratch.
